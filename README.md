This project builds an ETL pipeline to separate data files regarding crowdfunding.

In the project, I utiltized the crowdfunding.xlsx file that was provided to create a category and subcategory dataframes. The result was csv file that can be used to filter and search for a company's campaign information including by category and subcategory.

An Excel file of contact information was cleaned by using Pandas. The result was a clean csv file that can be efficiently used to filter and search for a contact's first_name, last_name, and email. I structured and cleaned the data to create DataFrames for Categories, Subcategories, Campaigns, and Contacts and also used SQL to creat the all tables . Looking at the four CSV files that were made prior, I had to make an ERD using the QuickDBD which was then converted into a schema and finally also used jupyter notebook to run all the codes.
